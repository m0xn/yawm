## Installation
At the mooment of writing this readme file (*08/23/2025*), the **1.1 version** is available for **Windows** and **Linux** for the **x86** (*32 and 64 bits*) and the 
**arm** architectures. To download the app, you can head over to [Releases](https://github.com/m0xn/yawm/releases), where you'll find executable files
for each one of the binaries mentioned earlier (*The format for Linux is `yawm_linux.<architecture>` and for Windows `yawm_windows.<architecture>.exe`.):

Then, saving your desired binary to your computer is as easy as clicking on the file you want to download.
Finally, you can move the executable wherever you want and **start using the program**.

> [!NOTE]
> Right now, Windows recognizes this app as *untrusted* showing the user the "Windows protected your PC" popup the first time you open the app. There's
> nothing to worry about, **it is not malware**. I'll be sending the app for **malware analysis** to see if I can get rid of it, but for now, you can
> just click on **More info** and then on the **Run anyway** button.

> [!NOTE]
> Linux users will need to grant the program **execute permissions** using the `chmod` command:
> ```
> chmod +x yawm_linux.<architecture>
> ```
